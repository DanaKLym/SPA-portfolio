      <p>
        I'm a developer in training and still very much at the beginning of my
        journey. It started with some projects created as a part of SheCodes
        Workshops! I am currently learning React and I am also seeking the
        opportunities to improve my skills. If you want to take a closer look of
        what I am up to, check out my Projects page!
